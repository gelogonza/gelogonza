### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [**Angelo**](https://gelogonza.com), a computer science student from Louisville, KY.

I'm very interested in **full-stack development**, but I am very passionate about front-end.

Aside from software development, I'm interested in technological advancements, developments in science, working out, and playing video games.
